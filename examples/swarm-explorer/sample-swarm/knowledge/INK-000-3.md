title: "TMUX split-pane pattern for Claude Code TUI"
description: "Claude Code can launch terminal UIs in adjacent TMUX panes using tmux split-window. This gives Claude a second terminal for interactive output."
context: "When building interactive terminal tools that Claude Code needs to display alongside its conversation"
recommendation: "Use tmux split-window -h -p 50 -c <dir> 'command' to launch TUIs. The -c flag sets working directory. Ink's stdout dimensions correctly detect TMUX pane size."
